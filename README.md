# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh 

# React Router DOM Practice Project

This project is a React application that demonstrates the usage of React Router DOM to implement navigation for three distinct sections: Home, Category, and Area.

## Sections:

### Home
The home section displays randomized food items and allows users to view details of the individual food items.

### Category
In the category section, users can explore food items categorized by specific categories.

### Area
In the area section, users can explore food items categorized by specific areas.

## Technologies Used:
- react-router-dom
- tailwind CSS
- daisyUI

## Issues:
Currently, the application is not fully responsive.
